# Email Deliverability Best Practices Guide

## Why Emails Go to Spam

Emails can be marked as spam due to various factors:
1. **Sender Reputation**: Your email address/domain reputation
2. **Content Quality**: Spam-like words, formatting, links
3. **Authentication**: Missing SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
4. **Recipient Engagement**: Low open rates, high bounce rates
5. **Volume & Frequency**: Sending too many emails too quickly

## Best Practices to Avoid Spam Folder

### 1. Sender Authentication
- **SPF Record**: Add to your domain's DNS settings
- **DKIM**: Enable domain key signing
- **DMARC**: Set up domain-based message authentication
- **Consistent From Address**: Always use the same sender email

### 2. Content Guidelines
- **Avoid Spam Words**: FREE, URGENT, ACT NOW, GUARANTEED, etc.
- **Balanced Text/HTML**: Don't use only images
- **Professional Formatting**: Proper spacing, no excessive caps
- **Clear Subject Lines**: Descriptive but not misleading
- **Include Unsubscribe**: Always provide opt-out option

### 3. Technical Setup
- **Valid Reply-To**: Use a monitored email address
- **Proper Headers**: Include all required email headers
- **List-Unsubscribe Header**: RFC compliant unsubscribe
- **Message-ID**: Unique identifier for each email

### 4. Sending Practices
- **Warm Up**: Start with small volumes, gradually increase
- **Rate Limiting**: Don't send too many emails at once
- **Clean Lists**: Remove invalid/bounced email addresses
- **Permission-Based**: Only email people who opted in

### 5. Gmail-Specific Tips
- **App Passwords**: Use App Passwords instead of regular password
- **2FA**: Enable two-factor authentication
- **Less Secure Apps**: Keep disabled, use OAuth2 if possible
- **Reputation**: Build sender reputation gradually
